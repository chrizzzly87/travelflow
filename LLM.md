# LLM.md

## Global model guidance
- Read `docs/UPDATE_FORMAT.md` at the start of work.
- Keep code changes aligned with existing architecture and route stability.
- Any completed feature/fix must be reflected in `content/updates/*.md`.

## Update entry policy
- User-facing items: `- [x] [Type] ...`
- Internal-only items: `- [ ] [Internal] ...`
- Most important changes first, fixes later.
- Bump and maintain strictly increasing release versions for published entries.
