summary: "Not-approved activities now use the same subdued tentative styling language as not-approved city stays."

## Changes
- [x] [Improved] 🎨 Not-approved activities now keep stronger color contrast while still using a subtle lower-opacity appearance to signal tentative status.
- [x] [Improved] 🪄 Not-approved activities now show subtle diagonal stripes with a clearer dashed border so tentative items remain easy to spot.
- [x] [Fixed] 🧭 Vertical calendar transfers now render two clearly separated connector lines with a small vertical offset from each city edge, matching the horizontal connector feel while preserving mini city gaps.
- [x] [Improved] 📐 Vertical calendar spacing now gives transfers more room, restores visible transfer connector lines, keeps mini gaps between city cards, and uses fixed-width activity lanes for clearer overlaps.
- [ ] [Internal] 🧩 Extended timeline block inactive styling logic so activity cards and city cards share the same modern color-mix rendering approach.
