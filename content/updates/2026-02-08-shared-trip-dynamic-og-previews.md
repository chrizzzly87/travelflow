## Changes
- [x] [New feature] 🚀 Sharing is caring: shared trip links now generate a beautiful social preview with your trip title, timing, distance, and route map.
- [x] [Improved] ✨ Shared preview maps now follow your saved trip view settings (map style, route style, and stop labels) so links match what people see in the trip.
- [x] [Fixed] 🐛 Unsupported OG query parameters are now safely ignored so shared-trip pages keep loading instead of breaking.
- [ ] [Internal] 🧰 Added edge metadata/image plumbing and caching hooks for OG rendering reliability.
- [ ] [Internal] 🧰 Added the OG playground workflow for faster layout tuning during development.
