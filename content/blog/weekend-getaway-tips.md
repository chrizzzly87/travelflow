## The Case for Short Trips

Long vacations are wonderful but rare. Most people get a handful of extended holidays per year. Weekend getaways, on the other hand, can happen monthly — and they add up to more travel days than you'd think.

A well-planned 3-day trip can feel more refreshing than a poorly planned 10-day one. The secret is reducing friction and maximizing time at the destination.

## The Friday Night Rule

If you can leave Thursday evening or early Friday morning, your trip gains an entire day. That's the difference between a rushed 2-day trip and a relaxed 3-day one.

For European city breaks, Thursday evening flights are often cheaper than Friday ones. Book them. The extra night of accommodation costs less than the stress of cramming everything into two days.

## Pick the Right Distance

The golden zone for weekend trips is **1-3 hours of travel time** from your front door to the hotel. Beyond that, you're spending too much of your weekend in transit.

This means:

- **1-hour flights** — perfect for European city hops (London → Amsterdam, Berlin → Prague)
- **2-3 hour trains** — often door-to-door faster than flying (Paris → Brussels, Tokyo → Kyoto)
- **Driving 2-3 hours** — ideal for countryside escapes, coastal towns, and mountain retreats

Avoid connections. A 90-minute direct flight beats a 4-hour journey with a layover every time.

## The One-Bag Weekend

Pack a single carry-on or backpack. No checked luggage. This alone saves you 45-60 minutes per direction (check-in queues, baggage carousel, potential lost bag stress).

Weekend packing list:

- 2 outfits that mix and match
- One pair of comfortable walking shoes
- A light jacket
- Toiletries in a small pouch
- Phone charger and one adapter if needed
- That's it

You're going for 2-3 days, not emigrating. If you forget something, buy it there.

## Research Just Enough

Over-researching kills spontaneity. For a weekend trip, you need:

1. **One must-do activity** — the reason you're going (a museum, a hike, a food market)
2. **Two restaurant reservations** — one for each evening, ideally booked a week ahead
3. **A rough neighborhood map** — know where the interesting areas are so you can wander with purpose

Everything else? Figure it out when you get there. Ask your hotel, follow your nose, and embrace getting slightly lost.

## Accommodation Sweet Spot

For weekend trips, location beats everything else. Pay a bit more to stay central. Walking distance to the main sights means:

- No wasted time on transit
- You can pop back to the hotel for a break
- Late nights out don't require expensive taxi rides

Boutique hotels and well-reviewed apartments in the city center are usually worth the premium. You're only paying for 2-3 nights.

## The Saturday Deep Dive

Use Saturday — your one full day — for the main event. This is when you:

- Visit the headline attraction first thing (before crowds build)
- Explore the most interesting neighborhood on foot
- Have a proper lunch at a place you've researched
- Leave the afternoon open for whatever catches your eye

Don't schedule Saturday to the minute. The best weekend trips have one solid anchor and lots of space around it.

## Sunday Morning Magic

Sunday mornings in most cities are quieter. Use this time for:

- Markets (most European cities have Sunday morning markets)
- A leisurely breakfast at a local cafe
- A walk through a park or along a waterfront
- One final museum or viewpoint before heading to the airport

Aim to leave by mid-afternoon. Late Sunday flights mean you arrive home exhausted with a Monday morning alarm looming.
