## Japan Is a Four-Season Destination

Unlike tropical destinations where weather is broadly "hot" or "rainy," Japan offers dramatically different experiences depending on when you visit. Each season brings distinct landscapes, festivals, food, and energy. There's no single "best" time — only the best time for what you want to do.

## Spring (March – May)

### Cherry Blossom Season: Late March to Mid-April

This is Japan's most iconic season. The sakura front moves north from Kyushu to Hokkaido over several weeks:

- **Tokyo**: Late March to early April
- **Kyoto**: Early to mid-April
- **Osaka**: Late March to early April
- **Hokkaido**: Early to mid-May

Peak bloom lasts about one week per location. Parks fill with hanami (flower viewing) picnics, temples glow pink, and the entire country celebrates.

### Practical Notes for Spring

- Book 3-6 months ahead — accommodation sells out fast during cherry blossom season
- Temperatures are mild (10-20°C) but bring layers for cool evenings
- Golden Week (late April to early May) is a major holiday — domestic travel spikes, prices jump, and trains are packed. Avoid if possible.

## Summer (June – August)

### The Rainy Season: June to Mid-July

Tsuyu (rainy season) brings humidity and regular rainfall across most of Japan. It's not constant rain — more like afternoon showers and overcast skies. Hydrangeas bloom beautifully during this period.

### Festival Season: July and August

Summer is matsuri (festival) season. Highlights include:

- **Gion Matsuri** in Kyoto (July) — one of Japan's most famous festivals
- **Tenjin Matsuri** in Osaka (July) — river processions and fireworks
- **Nebuta Matsuri** in Aomori (August) — giant illuminated floats
- **Awa Odori** in Tokushima (August) — mesmerizing street dancing

Summer temperatures hit 30-35°C with high humidity. Pack light, breathable clothing and stay hydrated.

### Escape the Heat

Head to the Japanese Alps, Hokkaido, or the northern Tohoku region for cooler temperatures. Hokkaido's summer (20-25°C) is genuinely pleasant — lavender fields in Furano, seafood in Hakodate, and hiking in Daisetsuzan National Park.

## Autumn (September – November)

### Koyo: Autumn Foliage

Japan's autumn colors rival New England's — and the cultural backdrop makes them even more spectacular. The koyo front moves south from Hokkaido:

- **Hokkaido**: Late September to mid-October
- **Tohoku**: Mid-October to early November
- **Tokyo & Kyoto**: Mid-November to early December

### Why Autumn Might Be the Best Season

- Comfortable temperatures (15-25°C in October)
- Lower crowds than cherry blossom season
- Incredible food — matsutake mushrooms, sanma (Pacific saury), persimmons, and new rice
- Stunning photography opportunities at temples surrounded by red and gold maples

Nikko, Kyoto's Arashiyama, and the Koyasan temple stay are particularly spectacular in autumn.

## Winter (December – February)

### Powder Snow and Hot Springs

Japan receives some of the deepest, lightest powder snow in the world. Hokkaido and the Japanese Alps are world-class ski destinations:

- **Niseko** (Hokkaido) — international resort town with consistent powder
- **Hakuba** (Nagano) — Olympic-quality slopes, closer to Tokyo
- **Nozawa Onsen** — traditional village with skiing and hot springs

### Winter Culture

- **Illuminations**: Tokyo, Osaka, and Kobe light up with spectacular displays from November through February
- **Onsen season**: Nothing beats a rotenburo (outdoor hot spring) with snow falling around you
- **Sapporo Snow Festival** (early February) — massive ice sculptures and snow art

### Winter Travel Tips

- Temperatures: 0-10°C in Tokyo, well below zero in mountain regions
- Trains run reliably even in heavy snow
- Fewer tourists than spring and autumn — better prices and shorter queues

## Planning Your Japan Trip

Whatever season you choose, two weeks is the sweet spot for a first visit. Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and one wildcard destination (Hiroshima, Hakone, or Kanazawa) give you the greatest contrast.
