## Europe on a Budget Is Not What It Used to Be

The old backpacker playbook — hostels, overnight buses, supermarket sandwiches — still works. But modern budget travel in Europe is more nuanced. You can travel affordably without sacrificing comfort if you know where to look.

The biggest savings come from three areas: when you go, how you move, and where you eat.

## Timing Is Everything

### Shoulder Season (April–May, September–October)

This is the sweet spot. Weather is good, prices are 30-40% lower than peak summer, and major attractions aren't rammed. Southern Europe (Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal) is particularly pleasant in these months.

### Off-Season Gems

Some destinations are better off-season:

- **Prague in November** — atmospheric, uncrowded, and Christmas markets start late month
- **Lisbon in February** — mild winters (12-15°C), empty viewpoints, and local prices
- **Scotland in September** — autumn colors, whisky festival season, and Highlands without midges

### Avoid These Expensive Windows

- Easter week in Southern Europe
- Summer school holidays (mid-June to August)
- Christmas and New Year everywhere
- Any city during a major conference or event

## Getting Around Cheaply

### Trains

- **Interrail/Eurail passes** save money on 4+ long journeys. Book early for seat reservations on popular routes
- **Regional trains** are often unreserved and cheaper — combine them for medium distances
- **Night trains** are making a comeback — you save a night's accommodation while traveling (Vienna → Rome, Zurich → Barcelona)

### Budget Airlines

- **Ryanair, easyJet, Wizz Air** — cheap if you follow their rules (carry-on only, online check-in, no extras)
- Book directly on the airline website (aggregators sometimes have different baggage rules)
- Tuesday and Wednesday flights are typically cheapest
- Secondary airports are sometimes far from the city — factor in transfer costs

### Buses

- **FlixBus** covers most of Europe. Not glamorous, but cheap and reliable
- Book 2-4 weeks ahead for the best prices
- Overnight buses save accommodation costs on longer routes

## Accommodation Strategies

### Beyond Hostels

Hostels are still great for solo travelers, but alternatives can be cheaper:

- **Apartments** — split between 2-3 people, often cheaper per person than hostels with better facilities
- **University accommodation** — available in summer months in many European cities
- **House-sitting** — free accommodation in exchange for looking after pets or plants

### Hostel Tips

- Private rooms in hostels are often cheaper than budget hotels
- Kitchens save you restaurant money — cook one meal per day
- Book directly with the hostel (avoid booking platform fees)
- Stay slightly outside the center — prices drop dramatically one metro stop away

## Eating Well for Less

### The Local Lunch Strategy

In Southern Europe (Italy, Spain, France, Portugal), lunch menus are the secret weapon:

- **Menu del día** (Spain) — a 3-course lunch with drink for €10-15
- **Pranzo** (Italy) — lunch specials at trattorias, half the dinner price
- **Formule midi** (France) — set lunch menus at restaurants that charge double at dinner

Eat your big meal at lunch. Have a light dinner from a bakery, market, or supermarket.

### Market Meals

Every European city has a food market. Some favorites:

- **Mercado da Ribeira** (Lisbon) — seafood, pastéis de nata, wine
- **Mercato Centrale** (Florence) — lampredotto, focaccia, gelato
- **Markthal** (Rotterdam) — international food under a stunning ceiling
- **Naschmarkt** (Vienna) — Middle Eastern food at reasonable prices

### Supermarket Is Not Shameful

European supermarkets stock excellent bread, cheese, cured meats, and wine. A supermarket picnic in a park costs €5-8 per person and can be the highlight of your day.

## Free and Cheap Activities

### Always Free

- Walking tours (tip-based) — available in every major European city
- Parks and gardens — Europe's urban green spaces are world-class
- Churches and cathedrals — most are free to enter
- Street markets and window shopping
- Sunset viewpoints

### Cheap Days

- Many museums have free entry one day per month (first Sunday in Paris, for example)
- City passes (Roma Pass, Amsterdam City Card) bundle transport and museums at a discount
- Student/youth discounts are widely available — bring an ISIC card

### The Free Walking Strategy

Budget one paid attraction per day. Fill the rest with walking, parks, markets, neighborhoods, and people-watching. The best European cities reveal themselves on foot.

## Country-by-Country Budget Guide

| Country | Daily Budget (mid-range) | Cheapest Month |
|---|---|---|
| Portugal | €50-70 | January–February |
| Spain | €55-75 | November–February |
| Italy | €60-80 | November, February |
| Greece | €45-65 | April–May, October |
| Czech Republic | €40-55 | November–March |
| Poland | €35-50 | November–March |
| Croatia | €50-70 | May, September–October |
| Hungary | €35-50 | November–March |

Eastern Europe (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania) is significantly cheaper than Western Europe for the same quality of experience.
